# TrigaGet

TrigaServer is a software to get from TrigaServer/TrigaMirror the real-time values of the Nuclear Reactor Triga IPR-R1 and save on hard-drive.

This version is written in Python for compatibility between Desktop operating systems such as GNU, BSD's, MacOS and Windows. Perhaps in the future a Dark-Flutter version will be written for compatibility, in addition to those already mentioned, with mobile operating systems such as Android and iOS.
